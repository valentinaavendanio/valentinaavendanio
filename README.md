### Hi there 👋

### I'm Valentina, I'm 21 years old. I live in Córdoba, Argentina and I'm a Full Stack Web Developer.

🙋🏻‍♀️I'm passionate about both Backend and Frontend and my current technology stack is: 
- Javascript 
- React 
- Redux
- Nodejs
- Express
- Postgresql 
- Sequelize
- GITHUB 
- GIT 
- HTML 
- CSS
- I am open to learn any other technology!

🔎 I am looking for new challenges, in order to improve my skills as a programmer and thus also gain experience in a work team where I could learn from my teammates.

### My projects!
